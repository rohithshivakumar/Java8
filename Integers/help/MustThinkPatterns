Things to Think when a question is asked based on category

Number questions

1. Integers or float
2. Division by Zeeero
3. Overflow
4. +ve and -ve cases
5. 0


String questions

1. ASCII
2. Long strings
3. One character String
4. Hashing algos if required
5. Space is available in the char array sometimes


Array questions

1. Watch out for IndexOutRange


Recursion
1. Base case

Design
1. Examples with Numbers

Bit Manipulation

1. XOR ( Same then yields zero, else yields one) Ex 0^0 is 1 but 0^1 is 0

Many recursive algos (especially with exponential runtimes), we can optimize this through memoization (a form of dynamic programming)
