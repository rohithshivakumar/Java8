1)After seeing comments on code changes, use this command to update same
git commit -va -m "updating git commit"

2) To remove local and remote branch
(removes local)
git branch -d rohithbranch
(removes remote)
git push origin :rohithbranch

3. To create a local branch and switch to it

git checkout -b <branch name>

4. Untracking and retracking files
Sometimes, you will need files to be untracked and dont want to commit this to the repo via .gitignore. This will
usually be files generated by your IDE etc which will be of no interest for other people who may be using different IDE

The following commands will make sure that this is just for your local copy
This will tell git you want to start ignoring the changes to the file
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file

When you want to start keeping track again
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file

5. Steps in committing and pushing a changes to remote
       git add <file(s)>
       git commit -m "Info about checkin"
       git push origin <current_branch_name>
