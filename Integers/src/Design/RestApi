What are the best practices to be followed while designing a REST API?
1) URI should be self explainatory
2) Operation should do a single function only (Atomicity)
3) It should be idempotent. Making same REST calls multiple times should yeild same result.
4) If there are 3 operations A,B and C of type POST, the results of B should not depend on A or C. Similarly for
   C and A
5) Lightweight
6) Data members should be clearly defined
7) API should not store any state
8) Versioning - There must be a way to specify version
e.g : http://x.y.z.a:<port>/resource/v1.0/
9) It should support HTTP and HTTPS
10) How collections (list of objects) are represented
11) Retain the original purpose of methods available (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
12) URI should use Singular and Plural for resources
13) Date or Time or Timestamp should follow ISO 8601 standard. Always use UTC.
