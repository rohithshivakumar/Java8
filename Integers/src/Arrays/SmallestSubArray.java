 * Created by arjun_000 on 9/16/2018.
 * Given two arrays of integers of size m and n. The task is to find the minimum length subarray in the first array that contains all the elements of second array.
 * Note: element of second array may be present in the large array in non-contiguous but order must same. ( m < n )
 * Examples :

 * Input :  A[] = {2, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
 * B[] = {2, 5, 9}
 * Output : 5
 *
 * Smallest subarray of A[] that contains all
 * elements of B[] is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9} which is
 * of size 5.
 *
 * Input :  A[] = {5, 6, 5, 2, 7, 5, 6, 7, 5, 5, 7}
 * B[] = {5, 5, 7}
 * Output : 3
